                <p>The team at Sybiltec have been working hard to help small businesses improve their online presence. We've launched a few new websites in 2025, including a site for a sustainable drinks brand, a mental health organisation and an online education platform. We're really proud of our work and our clients are very happy with the results.</p>

                        <h2>Realizzato</h2>
        
                        <p>Murray & Yeatman is a renowned distillery known for its bespoke spirits, commitment to quality and innovative approach to sustainable production.</p>
        
                        <p>Realizzato is Murray &amp; Yeatman's latest product; it isn't your typical coffee liqueur - it's crafted from upcycled coffee grounds for a premium and sustainable experience. The packaging is eco-friendly too - Realizzato is bottled in 100% recycled glass with a recycled label - further proof of their dedication to sustainability. The unique distillation process produces a robust, distinctive coffee character, which you can enjoy whilst knowing you are doing good for the planet.</p>
        
                        <p>To showcase and celebrate the launch of Realizzato, we collaborated with Scott Saunders of <a href="https://digitalmarketinggroundworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Marketing Groundworks</a> to design and develop a dedicated website for the product. The dark tones of the website design perfectly capture the mood and flavour of an indulgent coffee liqueur experience, contrasting with the bright green and gold, which represent an ethical, planet-friendly and premium quality product.</p>

                        <h2>Ken Chu Videography</h2>
        
                        <p>Ken Chu Videography provides a high-quality videography service to businesses and non-profit organisations. Ken Chu Videography is based in South London, serving clients in London, Kent, Surrey, Sussex and other locations around the UK.</p>

                        <p>We worked very closely with Emma Meheux, an SEO specialist, copywriter and sales/marketing expert of over 25 years who runs <a href="https://www.brandplanning.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brand Planning Ltd</a>, a small strategic planning consultancy. Emma identified areas of improvement with Ken's previous website, developed the sitemap, planned the structure of the website, and created all of the written content for the new site.</p>

                        <p>Sybil's job was then to combine the written content with the images and videos (provided by Ken), to create a redesigned website. The result is a user-friendly, search engine optimised and visually appealing website that truly showcases the expertise and full range of services offered by Ken Chu Videography. It will no doubt boost Ken Chu's online presence significantly and bring in new business for years to come. The new website went live on 1st May 2025.</p>

                        <p>Working on this project was especially enjoyable - collaborating with Ken and Emma involved an interaction between three business owners with unique experiences and complementary skills, which contributed to the success of the project.</p>

                        <p>Good Mental Health's qualified therapists provide tailored treatment in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitisation &amp; reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. They are a team of BABCP accredited therapists, who have several years of experience working in the NHS and in the private sector. The organisation is led by Muge Ahmet.</p>
        
                        <p>The original website was built on Wix. We successfully migrated the website to WordPress for improved speed, and ease of use for the client. We maintained the look and feel of the original website, however, we felt that using green as the primary colour was more appropriate for creating a sense of wellness. The updated branding features a new, minimalist logo and refreshed colours (Grass Green), reflecting a new direction for the wellbeing organisation.</p>
                        
                        <p>Muge Ahmet says, <em>"Sybil was excellent. She designed me a great website and it's very easy for me to make my own edits."</em></p>

                        <p>The Tech Diplomacy Academy is the world's first educational platform at the intersection of technology, business and geopolitics. It is a non-profit initiative of Purdue University, and made possible by the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. Their mission is to ensure that technology advances freedom.</p>
        
                        <p>This long-term project involved designing and developing a website to showcase the range of courses offered by the Tech Diplomacy Academy and to inform prospective learners about the mission of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. The website underwent several stages of development, with the latest version going live in April 2025. The improved website features separate sections targeted at our distinct audiences of individuals, business leaders and government leaders.</p>
        
                        <p>Additional services include landing page design/development, and creation of Looker Studio dashboards, which provide analytics to empower the leadership team to make strategic business decisions.</p>
