                <button class="collapsible"><strong>2. Do you offer ongoing digital support?</strong></button>
                <div class="content"><p>Absolutely. My clients enjoy the high quality service that I provide, and as a result, they often choose me as their long-term business partner. The ongoing service consists of a fixed number of hours per month, so you know that support is always available when you need it. During our initial consultation, we will agree on a plan that's tailored exactly to your requirements.</p></div>

                <button class="collapsible"><strong>3. What are the benefits of working with you?</strong></button>
                <div class="content"><p>Jargon-free communication, transparency (no hidden costs or nasty surprises), one-to-one, personalised service, and expertise gained from 6+ years of working in the IT sector.</p></div>

                <button class="collapsible"><strong>4. What kinds of businesses do you work with?</strong></button>
                <div class="content"><p>My preferred clients are established small business owners who are serious about expanding their business and 'taking it to the next level'. They may want to utilise digital tools to grow their business, but lack the time and/or expertise to perform the required setup and configuration.</p></div>
                
                <button class="collapsible"><strong>5. Which geographical areas do you serve?</strong></button>
                <div class="content"><p>The short answer is, all areas! My clients are primarily based in London, but as I can operate on a remote working basis, I can serve businesses anywhere in the UK, or in fact anywhere in the world.</p></div>
                
                <button class="collapsible"><strong>6. Would we need to meet in person?</strong></button>
                <div class="content"><p>If you are based within the Greater London area, I would highly recommend that we meet in person, at least for our initial consultation. Face-to-face interactions strengthen relationships, build trust, and meeting over a coffee is much more enjoyable in person than over Zoom! Of course, if an offline meeting isn't feasible, I'm happy to conduct all meetings via a video conferencing platform of your choice.</p></div>
                
                <button class="collapsible"><strong>7. I need help with an issue which is not listed on your website. Can you help me?</strong></button>
                <div class="content"><p>I also work with other independent consultants, so if you need a service that I don't provide directly, chances are I know someone who does. So please do <a href="https://sybiltec.com/contact/">reach out to me</a> so we can discuss the best course of action for your needs.</p></div>

                    <button class="collapsible"><strong>1. How much does a website cost?</strong></button>
                    <div class="content"><p>This would very much depend on the requirements of your project. Please <a href="https://sybiltec.com/contact/">get in touch</a> with me to arrange an initial consultation, after which I can provide a detailed and accurate quote for you.</p></div>
                </div>

                <button class="collapsible"><strong>2. Why should I work with you instead of with a web design agency?</strong></button>
                <div class="content"><p>Working with an agency often entails dealing with project managers, slow communication, rigid timescales and high costs. On the other hand, working with a freelancer such as myself, you will experience a flexible, affordable service which is customised exactly to your needs. Additionally, I'm a business owner myself and I know what it takes to build a business from the ground up. I understand your frustrations and pain points, and so I aim to make the process as seamless as possible.</p></div>

                <button class="collapsible"><strong>3. Can you help me to migrate my website to a different platform?</strong></button>
                <div class="content"class="content"><p>Yes. If your current website platform isn't working for you for any reason, I can help you to migrate it. Common migrations I have performed in the past include Wix to WordPress, Wix to Shopify and Squarespace to Shopify.</p></div>
