Having a good online presence is one of the best ways to get new customers and so one of the first things you'd want to do to improve your online presence is to create a website. There are many reasons why you may need a website. If you are a startup you may be trying to secure funding, and you need a proof of concept. Or if you run a medium-sized business you may need a larger website to showcase your services, clients, case studies, testimonials, portfolio of work and so on. But websites are not just for startups or larger businesses - even if you are a sole trader or self-employed, and you run a coaching or mentoring business for example, then having a personal website is crucial for you too."

However, there is a learning curve associated with it, so if your time is limited and you want to get started more quickly, then Wix would be more suitable as it's user-friendly for those who are managing their first website. Then finally we have Shopify: if you run an e-commerce business then Shopify is the best choice as it includes everything you need to get started with selling your products or services online."

                      <li>Put the most important information 'above the fold' (this is what the visitor sees when they first open your homepage, without scrolling down)</li>
                      <li>Check whether your website displays beautifully on desktop, mobile and tablet devices</li>
                      <li>Remove any large photos or videos that may be slowing down the website</li>
                      <li>Place a strong call-to-action on the homepage so that visitors know what to do. This can be a button like 'Contact Us', 'Get a Quote' or 'Buy Now'</li>
                      <li>Don't use too many colours and fonts.</li>

                <h2>General Questions</h2>
                <hr class="left-align">

                <h3>Why do I need a website?</h3>
                <p>Every day there are thousands of searches being carried out on search engines by people looking for information on products and services. Having a good online presence is one of the best ways to get new customers and so one of the first things you'd want to do to improve your online presence is to create a website.</p>

                <p>There are many reasons why you may need a website. If you are a startup you may be trying to secure funding, and you need a proof of concept. Or if you run a medium-sized business you may need a larger website to showcase your services, clients, case studies, testimonials, portfolio of work and so on.</p>

                <p>But websites are not just for startups or larger businesses - even if you are a sole trader or self-employed, and you run a coaching or mentoring business for example, then having a personal website is crucial for you too.</p>

                <h3>Which platform is best for my needs?</h3>
                <p>WordPress is the most flexible platform, so if you need a website that will adapt as your business grows, then I would recommend WordPress. However, there is a learning curve associated with it, so if your time is limited and you want to get started more quickly, then Wix would be more suitable as it's user-friendly for those who are managing their first website. Then finally we have Shopify: if you run an e-commerce business then Shopify is the best choice as it includes everything you need to get started with selling your products or services online.</p>

                <h3>What are the differences between Shopify and WooCommerce?</h3>
                <p>Please read my blog article on <a href="https://sybiltec.com/shopify-woocommerce">Shopify vs WooCommerce: What Are the Differences?</a> which compares the world's two most popular e-commerce platforms.</p>

                <h3>How can I improve the design of my homepage?</h3>
                <p>Here are a few tips that you can apply to improve the design of your homepage:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If a visitor is viewing your website for the first time, would it be clear to them what your business does within the first 3 seconds? If not, make some changes!</li>
                    <li>Put the most important information "above the fold" (this is what the visitor sees when they first open your homepage, without scrolling down)</li>
                    <li>Check whether your website displays beautifully on desktop, mobile and tablet devices</li>
                    <li>Remove any large photos or videos that may be slowing down the website</li>
                    <li>Place a strong call-to-action on the homepage so that visitors know what to do. This can be a button like "Contact Us", "Get a Quote" or "Buy Now"</li>
                    <li>Don't use too many colours and fonts.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How do I update my WordPress website?</h3>
                <p>Please take a look at my blog post: <a href="https://sybiltec.com/guide-to-updating-your-wordpress-website">A Guide to Updating Your WordPress Website</a>.</p>

                <h3>Which Shopify plan is best for me?</h3>
                <p>If you are just beginning your e-commerce business, then I would recommend choosing the Basic Shopify plan which provides everything you need to start selling your products or services online. When you feel that you are ready to take your business to the next level, you can upgrade to the Shopify plan, which offers advanced features and an enhanced e-commerce experience.</p>

                <h2>Website Services Questions</h2>
                <hr class="left-align">

                <h3>What services do you offer?</h3>
                <p>The services I offer are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Website review</li>
                    <li>Website design</li>
                    <li>Website development</li>
                    <li>Website maintenance</li>
                    <li>Training</li>
                    <li>Leaflet design</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Which platforms do you work with?</h3>
                <p>New websites will be developed on Wix, WordPress or Shopify. If you have an existing website built on an alternative platform, for example BigCommerce or Squarespace, I can provide support for these too.</p>

                <h3>What kinds of businesses do you work with?</h3>
                <p>My preferred clients are business owners of established businesses who are serious about improving and growing their online presence.</p>

                <h3>Where are you based?</h3>
                <p>My business is based in Bexley, South East London.</p>

                <h3>What geographical areas do you serve?</h3>
                <p>My clients are primarily based in London, but as I operate on a remote working basis I can serve clients anywhere in the UK, or in fact anywhere in the world!</p>

                <h3>How much does a full website build cost?</h3>
                <p>This would very much depend on the requirements of the project. Please <a href="https://sybiltec.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get in touch</a> with me to arrange an initial consultation, after which I can provide a detailed and accurate quote for you. </p>

                <h3>How long does it take to build a full website?</h3>
                <p>The time it takes to complete the work would depend on the complexity of the project. A 5-page website could be completed in as little as 4 weeks depending on how quickly I receive the required information. In order for the work to be completed as soon as possible, please provide the required information promptly. An estimated timeframe for completion of the project can be discussed during our initial call.</p>

                <h3>What do I need to provide you with?</h3>
                <li>Copy and content for each page</li>
                <li>Company logo</li>
                <li>Branding guidelines</li>
                <li>Any partner logos</li>
                <li>High quality images (if you don't have your own images, I can provide you with links to free stock photo sites, or better still, I can recommend a reputable photography service)</li>
                <li>Links to social media profiles</li>
                <li>Any videos</li>
                <li>Access to your domain and hosting</li>
                <li>Examples of websites that inspire you</li>

                <p>Preferably, I would like to work with documents submitted via Google Drive - I can provide you with a link to a shared folder. Alternatively, please send me the content by email.</p>

                <h3>What can I expect from the website design process?</h3>
                <p>You can read about my complete website design process in my blog post, <a href="https://sybiltec.com/web-design-process-explained-12-easy-steps">The Web Design Process Explained in 12 Easy Steps</a>.</p>

                <h3>Would we need to meet in person?</h3>
                <p>I operate on a remote working basis, so it's possible for us to hold all meetings online. I can meet via Zoom, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams. However, if we are within a travelling distance of each other, I would highly recommend that we meet in person at least for our initial meeting.</p>

                <h3>Can I see examples of your previous work?</h3>
                <p>Of course, please see the <a href="https://sybiltec.com/website-design">Website Design</a> page for examples of web design projects I have completed for past clients.</p>

                <h3>What are your payment terms?</h3>
                <p>For website design or website development projects, I will ask for a deposit which will be 25-50% of the total cost, depending on the size of the project. The remainder of the payments will be taken throughout the project and upon project completion.</p>

                <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
                <p>I accept payments via bank transfer for all services.</p>

                <p>If you would like to purchase one of my website maintenance services, you can also do so directly via the <a href="https://sybiltec.com/website-maintenance">Website Maintenance</a> page. All major debit and credit cards are accepted.</p>

                <h3>What qualifications do you hold?</h3>
                <p>My most recent qualification is an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Kent.</p>

                <h3>I cannot find the answer to my question in these FAQs. How can I contact you?</h3>
                <p>Please contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
