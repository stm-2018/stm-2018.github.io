Having a good online presence is one of the best ways to gain new customers and so one of the first things you'd want to do to improve your online presence is to create a website. There are many reasons why you may need a website. If you are a start-up you may be trying to secure funding, and you need a proof of concept. Or, if you run a medium-sized business you may need a larger website to showcase your services, clients, case studies, testimonials, portfolio of work and so on. But websites are not just for start-ups or larger businesses - even if you are a sole trader or are self-employed, and you run a coaching or mentoring business for example, then having a personal website is crucial for you too."

However, there is a learning curve associated with it, so if your time is limited and you want to get started more quickly, then Wix would be more suitable as it's user-friendly for those who are managing their first website. Then finally we have Shopify: if you run an e-commerce business then Shopify is the best choice as it includes everything you need to get started with selling your products or services online."

                <h2>General Questions</h2>
                <hr class="left-align">

                <p><strong>1. Why do I need a website?</strong></p>
                <p>Every day there are thousands of searches being carried out on search engines by people looking for information on products and services. Having a good online presence is one of the best ways to gain new customers and so one of the first things you'd want to do to improve your online presence is to create a website.</p>

                <p>There are many reasons why you may need a website. If you are a start-up you may be trying to secure funding, and you need a proof of concept. Or, if you run a medium-sized business you may need a larger website to showcase your services, clients, case studies, testimonials, portfolio of work and so on.</p>

                <p>But websites are not just for start-ups or larger businesses - even if you are a sole trader or are self-employed, and you run a coaching or mentoring business for example, then having a personal website is crucial for you too.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Which platform is best for my needs?</strong></p>
                <p>WordPress is the most flexible platform, so if you need a website that will adapt as your business grows, then we would recommend WordPress. However, there is a learning curve associated with it, so if your time is limited and you want to get started more quickly, then Wix would be more suitable as it's user-friendly for those who are managing their first website. Then finally we have Shopify: if you run an e-commerce business then Shopify is the best choice as it includes everything you need to get started with selling your products or services online.</p>

                <h2>Website Services Questions</h2>
                <hr class="left-align">

                <p><strong>1. What services do you offer?</strong></p>
                <p>The services we offer include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Website review</li>
                    <li>Website design</li>
                    <li>Website development</li>
                    <li>Website maintenance</li>
                    <li>Workshops</li>
                    <li>Leaflet design</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>2. Which platforms do you work with?</strong></p>
                <p>New websites will be developed on Wix, WordPress or Shopify. If you have an existing website built on an alternative platform, for example BigCommerce or Squarespace, we may be able to provide support for these too - please <a href="https://sybiltec.com/contact/">contact us</a> to find out how we can help.</p>

                <p><strong>3. What kinds of businesses do you work with?</strong></p>
                <p>Our preferred clients are business owners of established businesses who are serious about improving and growing their online presence, and therefore may have an existing website which needs redesigning to reflect their new requirements. We can also work with start-ups who would like to build their first website.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Where are you based?</strong></p>
                <p>We are based in Bexley, South East London.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Which geographical areas do you serve?</strong></p>
                <p>Our clients are primarily based in South East London, but as we operate on a remote working basis we can serve clients anywhere in the UK, or in fact anywhere in the world!</p>

                <p><strong>6. How much does a full website build cost?</strong></p>
                <p>This would very much depend on the requirements of the project. Please <a href="https://sybiltec.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get in touch</a> with us to arrange an initial consultation, after which we can provide a detailed and accurate quote for you. </p>

                <p><strong>7. How long does it take to build a full website?</strong></p>
                <p>The time it takes to complete the work would depend on the complexity of the project. A 5-page website could be completed in as little as 4 weeks depending on how quickly we receive the required information. In order for the work to be completed as soon as possible, please provide the required information promptly. An estimated timeframe for completion of the project can be discussed during our initial call.</p>

                <p><strong>8. What do I need to provide you with?</strong></p>
                <li>Copy and content for each page</li>
                <li>Company logo</li>
                <li>Branding guidelines</li>
                <li>Any partner logos</li>
                <li>High quality images. If you don't have your own images, we can recommend a professional photography service. However, if this exceeds your budget, we will source appropriate stock photos (these may be free or paid).</li>
                <li>Links to social media profiles</li>
                <li>Any videos</li>
                <li>Access to your domain and hosting</li>
                <li>Examples of websites that inspire you</li>

                <p>We prefer to work with documents submitted via Google Drive - we can provide you with a link to a shared folder. Alternatively, please send us the content by email.</p>

                <p><strong>9. What can I expect from the website design process?</strong></p>
                <p>You can read about our complete website design process in our blog post, <a href="https://sybiltec.com/web-design-process-explained-12-easy-steps/">The Web Design Process Explained in 12 Easy Steps</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>10. Will my website work on mobile and tablet devices?</strong></p>
                <p>Of course. Considering that the majority of users are browing the internet via mobile devices nowadays, it's crucial that your website is mobile responsive. As part of the website development process, we carry out thorough testing to ensure that your website looks and functions beautifully on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets.</p>

                <p><strong>11. Will my website be compliant with data privacy laws?</strong></p>
                <p>For UK-based businesses, we will ensure that the relevant privacy notices and cookie banners are in place to ensure that your website meets the requirements of the UK GDPR. If your businesses is based outside of the UK, or your businesses processes personal information of users outside of the UK, our expert data protection partners will provide guidance - additional charges may apply.</p>

                <p><strong>12. Would we need to meet in person?</strong></p>
                <p>If you are based within a travelling distance of our offices at <a href="https://enginehousebexley.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Engine House</a>, we would highly recommend meeting in person at least once, especially during the early stages of the web design process. However, if this is not possible, or you are based outside of the local area, we are perfectly happy to hold all meetings online. We are able to meet via Zoom, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams, according to your preference.</p>

                <p><strong>13. Can I see examples of your previous work?</strong></p>
                <p>Of course, please see the <a href="https://sybiltec.com/small-business-web-design/">Website Design</a> page for examples of web design projects that we have completed for past clients.</p>

                <p><strong>14. What are your payment terms?</strong></p>
                <p>For website design or website development projects, we will ask for a deposit which will be 25-50% of the total cost, depending on the size of the project. The remainder of the payments will be taken throughout the project and upon project completion.</p>

                <p><strong>15. What payment methods do you accept?</strong></p>
                <p>We accept payments via bank transfer for all services.</p>
