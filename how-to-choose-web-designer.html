                <p>You've got a brilliant business idea and you can't wait to bring it to life. So the next natural step is to build your website so you can share it with the world! But wait, you realise that you have no experience in creating a website and you don't really have the time (as a small business owner, you probably already have a million other things to take care of already).</p>

                <p><strong>Hiring a web designer</strong> is one of the options available to you. The field of web design is a very competitive one, and with so many web designers around with a wide variety of skills and experience, how do you choose the best one for the job? Read my post to find out.</p>

                <h2>Be Clear on Your Requirements</h2>

                <p>Before starting to research web designers, the first thing you'll want to do is to define your requirements. Here are a few questions that you might be asked during the consultation call, so it's best to have the answers prepared well in advance, as these will determine the web designer that you ultimately choose to work with:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What is the nature of your business?</li>
                    <li>What is the size of your business?</li>
                    <li>How long has your business been trading for?</li>
                    <li>Where are you based, geographically?</li>
                    <li>What are your requirements for the project?</li>
                    <li>Which services are you seeking?</li>
                    <li>What is your budget?</li>
                    <li>Do you have a deadline in mind?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Where to Find Web Designers</h2>

                <p>Web designers can be found in a variety of places. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Asking your colleagues/friends/family members</li>
                    <li>Social media: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn</li>
                    <li>Online platforms: Nextdoor, Fiverr, Bark</li>
                    <li>Doing a Google search</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Read the Information on Their Website</h2>

                <p>Once you have selected a potential web designer, start by looking at their website. If they don't have one, I wouldn't go any further! </p>

                <p>Read the information carefully and as you go through the website, think about the design, user experience, navigation etc. Does it look professional? Is it easy to find what you are looking for? Are their contact details visible? Their website will give you a good indication of their personality, experience, skills and qualifications.</p>

                <p>Be aware of red flags like outdated information, broken links or missing contact details.</p>

                <p>Try contacting the web designer by email or phone and make a note of the time it takes them to respond.</p>

                <h2>Look at Their Portfolio</h2>

                <p>A web designer's portfolio will give you an insight into the types of projects that they have worked on in the past. Read any details they have provided. They may also have written case studies - these are a great way to find out which clients they have worked with, and how they have helped their clients achieve their business goals. If they have provided links to the clients' websites, click the links and view the live websites to explore them carefully.</p>

                <h2>Check Their Social Media</h2>

                <p>Having a presence on social media strengthens a web designer's online presence. Be sure to check if they have at least an Instagram or LinkedIn profile. </p>

                <p>Do they have a profile photo? Is their profile complete and up to date? Are they posting on a regular basis? Do their social media profiles match their website, in terms of branding, information, projects?</p>

                <h2>Verify Their Reviews or Testimonials</h2>

                <p>Good reviews are a strong indicator that a web designer has provided a satisfactory service to their clients. If there are no or very few reviews present, this may indicate that the web designer is new to their field, and may have little experience. </p>

                <p>Reviews can be found in various places, including their website, Google Business Profile, social media, or directories/platforms like Bark, Yelp or Nextdoor.</p>

                <h2>Ask Questions During the Consultation Call</h2>

                <p>Web designers usually offer a no-obligation initial consultation call, so I highly suggest taking advantage of this. During the consultation call, you will be asked questions about your business and your project requirements (as we discussed in point 1), but it's also a chance for you to find out as much as you can about the web designer. Remember: it's a two-way process and the purpose of the call is to find out if you and the web designer are a good fit for each other.</p>

                <p>Here are a few questions you may want to ask during the call:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What types of clients do you work with?</li>
                    <li>Can you provide me with examples of past projects?</li>
                    <li>Where are you based, geographically?</li>
                    <li>Do you operate solely online or can you meet me in person?</li>
                    <li>Which platforms/website builders do you work with?</li>
                    <li>Are you a freelancer or do you work for an agency?</li>
                    <li>How many years of experience do you have?</li>
                    <li>Which qualifications do you hold?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Please note, that "<strong>how much do you charge to design a website?</strong>" or "<strong>how much does a website cost?</strong>" are not great questions! The answer will definitely be “it depends”, and you will only be asked further questions about your requirements. The cost of a website will be dependent on many factors, including the size and complexity of your website, whether you need e-commerce functionality, whether you need additional integrations to be included etc.</p>

                <p>The web designer will need to gather all of your requirements, so be very specific when providing these. Only then will they be able to supply you with an accurate quote.</p>

                <h2>Making a Decision</h2>

                <p>Speak to a few web designers (3-4) and weigh up the pros and cons of each one. A lot of factors will go into influencing your final decision, so give yourself some time to think about it and don't rush into accepting any offers.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Building a website may be a daunting task if you've never done it before or you don't have the time and/or skills to do it. Hiring a professional may be the best option, but with so much choice, it's difficult to find the right person for the job. This blog post provided advice on how you can choose the best web designer for your project.</p>
