                <p>Date Updated: 27 December 2023 | by Sybil Mayard</p>
                <p>Are you planning to sell your products or services online? Consider choosing <strong>Shopify</strong>, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms. Here I present to 
                    you a few of the benefits you can enjoy.</p>

                <h2>1. Try It For Free</h2>
                <p>Before making any commitments, why not make use of Shopify's 3-day trial? 
                    After providing a few details about your business, you'll have access to a 
                    trial store where you can try out most of the available features. Make the 
                    most of your trial period to explore everything that Shopify has to offer, 
                    check out their support team, and experiment with different apps and themes. 
                    If Shopify is not the right solution for you, simply cancel your trial within
                    3 days and you won't be charged.</p>
                <p>If you need more time to work on your store before committing to a paid
                    plan, as a <strong>Shopify Partner</strong> I can give you access to an unlimited trial store - 
                    please <a href="https://sybiltec.com/contact/">contact us</a> and I can set this up for you!
                </p>

                <h2>2. Customise Your Theme Without Knowledge of Coding</h2>
                <p>Coding and design skills are not necessary to make your store look unique 
                    and fabulous! Shopify offers a selection of free and premium themes, all 
                    of which are responsive and mobile-friendly. The <strong>Shopify Theme Store</strong> showcases 
                    features, reviews and demos to help you choose the perfect design for your 
                    store. Use the customiser to easily edit the design, for example, adding 
                    images to a slideshow or changing fonts. Shopify gives you full access* 
                    to the theme files, so you can make further customisations by editing the 
                    code directly. If you don't have coding skills, however, hire an <a href="https://sybiltec.com/contact/">expert</a> 
                    to do the job for you.</p>

                <p>* Access to the checkout theme file is only available with Shopify Plus.</p>

                <h2>3. Thousands of Apps Provide Enhanced Functionality</h2>
                <p>Shopify offers many tools to help you get started straight out of the box. 
                    However, there are many reasons why you'd want to extend the functionality 
                    of your store. You may want to integrate your store with an ESP (email 
                    ervice provider). Or, you might need to translate your store into foreign 
                    languages. Fortunately, the <strong>Shopify App Store</strong> solves many of these problems. 
                    Within this marketplace, you can find over 8,000 apps to add features to your 
                    store. Many of these apps are free or offer a range of pricing plans to suit 
                    your budget and business size. Before purchasing an app, be sure to read the 
                    reviews or view a demo to see it in action.</p>

                <h2>4. Excellent SEO Tools</h2>
                <p>Search engine optimisation is the practice of tuning your website so that it 
                    ranks well in search results, increasing the chances of it being found through 
                    search. Shopify provides you with all of the essential tools for improving 
                    your store's <a href="https://sybiltec.com/improve-website-seo/">SEO</a>. You are able to set page titles and meta descriptions, 
                    alt tags for images, and create URL redirects. There is also a blogging 
                    feature, helping you keep your site updated with fresh content to entice 
                    your customers with. Plus, the online store speed report gives you insights 
                    and tips on how to improve its performance.</p>

                <h2>5. A Range of Plans Available</h2>
                <p>Shopify offers a variety of plans, so you're sure to find pricing that suits 
                    your needs. I recommend beginning with the Basic plan, which costs just 
                    £25/month. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time if your current plan 
                    isn't suitable for you. These are some of the benefits you can enjoy with all 
                    plans:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A free SSL certificate that doesn't expire</li>
                    <li>Connect your custom domain</li>
                    <li>Staff accounts</li>
                    <li>Low online credit card rates</li>
                    <li>No transaction fees with Shopify Payments</li>
                    <li>Fraud analysis</li>
                    <li>Unlimited products</li>
                    <li>Discount codes</li>
                    <li>Sell gift gards</li>
                    <li>24/7 access to support.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition to the three standard plans, there are also the options of:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Starter - a lightweight solution for selling on social media and other platforms</li>
                    <li>Retail - sell in store with advanced staff, inventory, and loyalty features</li>
                    <li>Shopify Plus - appropriate for large volume enterprises.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Make Your Business International</h2>
                <p>The new <strong>Shopify Markets</strong> feature is a cross-border
                    management tool that helps you manage your international markets without
                    having to maintain multiple stores. Using Shopify Payments, you can set
                    up your store to sell in multiple currencies, allowing your customers to
                    pay and receive funds in their local currency. At the time of publishing
                    this blog, 133 currencies are supported. In addition, you can use the
                    Geolocation app, which recommends the best language and currency for the
                    customer, based on their location.</p>
