                <p>Are you planning to sell your products or services online? Consider choosing 
                    <a href="https://shopify.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        Shopify</a>, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms. Here I present to 
                    you a few of the benefits you can enjoy.</p>

                <h2>Customisable Themes</h2>
                <p>Coding and design skills are not necessary to make your store look unique 
                    and fabulous! Shopify offers a selection of free and premium themes, all 
                    of which are responsive and mobile-friendly. The <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/" 
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Theme Store</a> showcases 
                    features, reviews and demos to help you choose the perfect design for your 
                    store. Use the customiser to easily edit the design, for example, adding 
                    images to a slideshow or changing fonts. Shopify gives you full access* 
                    to the theme files, so you can make further customisations by editing the 
                    code directly. If you don’t have coding skills, however, hire an <a href="/">expert</a> 
                    to do the job for you.</p>

                <h2>Shopify App Store</h2>
                <p>Shopify offers many tools to help you get started straight out of the box. 
                    However, there are many reasons why you’d want to extend the functionality 
                    of your store. You may want to integrate your store with an ESP (email 
                    ervice provider). Or, you might need to translate your store into foreign 
                    languages. Fortunately, the <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/" target="_blank" 
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify App Store</a> solves many of these problems. 
                    Within this marketplace, you can find over 4,500 apps to add features to your 
                    store. Many of these apps are free or offer a range of pricing plans to suit 
                    your budget and business size. Before purchasing an app, be sure to read the 
                    reviews or view a demo to see it in action.</p>

                <h2>Excellent SEO Tools</h2>
                <p>Search engine optimisation is the practice of tuning your website so that it 
                    ranks well in search results, increasing the chances of it being found through 
                    search. Shopify provides you with all of the essential tools for improving 
                    your store’s SEO. You are able to set page titles and meta descriptions, 
                    alt tags for images, and create URL redirects. There is also a blogging 
                    feature, helping you keep your site updated with fresh content to entice 
                    your customers with. Plus, the online store speed report gives you insights 
                    and tips on how to improve its performance.</p>

                <h2>A Range of Plans Available</h2>
                <p>Shopify offers a variety of plans, so you’re sure to find pricing that suits 
                    your needs. I recommend beginning with the Basic plan, which costs just 
                    $29/month. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time if your current plan 
                    isn’t suitable for you. These are some of the benefits you can enjoy with all 
                    plans:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A free SSL certificate that doesn’t expire</li>
                    <li>Connect your custom domain</li>
                    <li>Staff accounts</li>
                    <li>Low online credit card rates</li>
                    <li>No transaction fees with Shopify Payments</li>
                    <li>Fraud analysis</li>
                    <li>Unlimited products</li>
                    <li>Discount codes</li>
                    <li>24/7 access to support.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition to the three standard plans, there are also the options of:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener 
                        noreferrer">Shopify Plus</a>, appropriate for large volume enterprises</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/lite" target="_blank" rel="noopener 
                        noreferrer">Shopify Lite</a>, for selling on WordPress and other platforms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Try it Free for 14 Days</h2>
                <p>Before making any commitments, why not make use of Shopify’s trial period. 
                    After providing a few details about your business, you’ll have access to a 
                    trial store where you can try out most of the available features. Make the 
                    most of your trial period to explore everything that Shopify has to offer, 
                    check out their support team, and experiment with different apps and themes. 
                    If Shopify is not the right solution for you, simply cancel your trial within 
                    14 days and you won’t be charged.</p>

                <h2>Responsive Support Team</h2>
                <p>The support team is available to contact 24/7 by email, Twitter or chat. There 
                    is also a community forum where you can get answers from Experts and other 
                    Shopify merchants. You don’t need to have a Shopify store to gain access to 
                    support.</p>

                <h2>Selling in Multiple Currencies</h2>
                <p>Using Shopify Payments, you can set up your store to sell in multiple 
                    currencies. This allows your customers to pay and receive funds in their 
                    local currency. In addition, you can use the Geolocation app, which recommends 
                    the best language and currency for the customer, based on their location. At 
                    the time of publishing this blog, 133 currencies are supported.</p>
